/*
Intuition:
----------
We need to find the shortest path from the top-left cell (0,0) to the bottom-right cell (n-1,n-1)
in a binary matrix where 0 = free cell and 1 = blocked cell. Movement is allowed in all 8 directions
(up, down, left, right, and diagonals). Since all moves have equal cost (1 step), Breadth-First Search (BFS)
is the ideal choice â€” it explores all cells level by level and guarantees the shortest distance.

Approach:
---------
1. If the starting or ending cell is blocked, return -1 immediately (no path possible).
2. Use a BFS queue to store {distance_so_far, {row, col}} for each reachable cell.
3. Keep a 'dist' matrix to track the shortest distance to each cell; initialize with INT_MAX.
4. Start BFS from (0,0) with distance = 1 (counting the starting cell as a step).
5. From each cell, try moving in all 8 directions.
6. For each valid and unblocked neighbor cell, update the distance if a shorter path is found and push it into the queue.
7. At the end, check the distance to the bottom-right cell:
   - If still INT_MAX, it means no path was found, return -1.
   - Otherwise, return the stored distance as the shortest path length.
