/*
Intuition:
----------
We need to find the sum of the weights of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.
Primâ€™s algorithm grows the MST starting from any node, 
always picking the smallest weight edge that connects a visited node to an unvisited node.
We use a min-heap (priority_queue with greater<>) to efficiently get the smallest edge.

Approach:
---------
1. Convert the edge list into an adjacency list for efficient traversal.
2. Use a min-heap to store pairs of {weight, node}, always popping the smallest weight first.
3. Start from node 0 with weight 0.
4. While the heap is not empty:
   - Pop the smallest edge.
   - If the node is not visited:
       a) Mark it visited.
       b) Add its edge weight to the total sum.
       c) Push all its unvisited neighbors into the min-heap.
5. Repeat until all nodes are included in the MST.
6. Return the total sum of MST edge weights.
