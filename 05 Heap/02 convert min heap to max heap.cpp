ðŸ§  Revision Concepts You Should Remember
1. Heap Basics
A heap is a complete binary tree.

Max-Heap: Every parent â‰¥ both children.

Min-Heap: Every parent â‰¤ both children.

2. Heap Representation
Stored as an array.

For index i:

Left child â†’ 2*i + 1

Right child â†’ 2*i + 2

Parent â†’ (i - 1)/2

3. Why Start From N/2 - 1
Nodes from index N/2 to N-1 are leaf nodes and already satisfy heap property.

We only need to fix internal nodes.
