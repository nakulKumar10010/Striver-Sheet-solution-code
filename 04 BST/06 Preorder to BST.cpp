ðŸ§  Intuition:
In a Binary Search Tree (BST):

The left child is always less than the parent.

The right child is always greater than the parent.

In preorder traversal, we visit:
Root â†’ Left â†’ Right

So the first element is always the root, and all following elements must be placed into the BST while respecting BST properties.

ðŸ“Œ Approach:
Start with the first element as the root.

For every next element:

Compare it with the current node.

Go left if it's smaller.

Go right if it's larger.

When you find an empty position, insert the node.

Restart from root for the next element.

ðŸ§¾ Algorithm:
Create root from preorder[0].

Loop through the remaining elements:

Initialize curr as root.

Traverse left or right based on BST property.

Insert node when empty spot is found.

Reset curr to root for the next insertion.

Repeat until all nodes are inserted.

Return root
