üß† Intuition:
In a Binary Search Tree (BST):

Left child values < node

Right child values > node

In preorder traversal:

You visit Root ‚Üí Left ‚Üí Right

So, the first element is always the root

All following elements can be categorized as:

Belonging to the left subtree if they are smaller

Belonging to the right subtree if they are greater but within a certain bound

By maintaining a bound, we ensure elements are inserted only where they are valid in the BST.

üìå Approach:
Start from index 0 of the preorder array.

Use a recursive function:

Take the current element and create a node if it's ‚â§ bound.

Recursively build the left subtree with the current node's value as the new upper bound.

Recursively build the right subtree with the parent‚Äôs bound.

Automatically advances the index (i) through the preorder list without restarting each time.

üßæ Algorithm:
Define a recursive function build(arr, i, bound):

If i == arr.size() or arr[i] > bound: return NULL.

Create node root with arr[i++]

Build root->left with new bound root->val

Build root->right with existing bound

Initialize i = 0 and call build(preorder, i, INT_MAX)

Return the root of the constructed tree.

‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity:
Time: O(n) ‚Äî Every node is visited once.

Space: O(n) ‚Äî Due to recursion stack (worst case in skewed BST).
