  ðŸ§  Intuition:
In a Binary Search Tree (BST), for any node:
 Left subtree contains nodes with values smaller than the node.
 Right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the node.

So, to find the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA):
 If both nodes lie on the same side (left/right), move that way.
The moment the nodes split (one left, one right), or one matches the current node â†’ we've found the LCA.

---
ðŸ“Œ Approach:

* Start from the root.
* Use BST properties to move left/right.
* Keep traversing until a split occurs or one node is found.

---
 ðŸ§¾ Algorithm:

1. Start at root.
2. Compare root's value with `p` and `q`:
   * If root < p and root < q â†’ go right.
   * If root > p and root > q â†’ go left.
   * Else, root is the LCA.
3. Return the root when divergence or match is found.
